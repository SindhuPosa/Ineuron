    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas in Python, Modules are simply files with the . py extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes that you want to include in your application."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances attributes are passed to the class when an object of the class is created. Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by all objects of the classs. instead each object maintains its own copy of instance attributes at object level. whereas incase of class attributes all instances of class refer to a single copy. Usually instance attributes are defined within the __init__ method of class"

    "Consider that we have two objects which are a physical representation of a class (user-defined data type) and we have to add two objects with binary '+' operator it throws an error, because compiler don't know how to add two objects. So we define a method for an operator and that process is called operator overloading."
